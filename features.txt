# Ideas
- use predefined set of exercises rather than creating new exercises on the fly
- debug the way it saves user's data/preferences to Supabase (seems to be a little too trigger happy in overwriting info)
- add an onboarding flow where Logan collects basic info explicitly rather than randomly like today
    - separate out user info that is everlasting (fitness level) and user info for today's workout
- tweak the chat prompt to ask better questions, be more fun to talk to.
- turn the chat into a voice chat
- support timed workouts (like planks) instead of just reps
- clean up the UI
- chat summarization to keep from exceeding token limits
    - smart Summarization: Summarize old conversation and keep recent details
    - context Extraction: Extract key fitness info and discard old chat
    - conversation Chunking: Break into sessions when context grows too large
    - token Counting: Add token counting to monitor and truncate before limits
- ^use mem0.ai as a memory layer for this

# Completed
- start storing basic data about a user and then using that when they return to chat
