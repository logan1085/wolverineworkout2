# Top ideas
- Fix up the UI on mobile

# Ideas
- Use predefined set of exercises rather than creating new exercises on the fly
- Debug the way it saves data to Supabase (seems to be a little too trigger happy in overwriting info)
- Tweak the chat prompt to ask better questions, be more fun to talk to.
- Turn the chat into a voice chat
- Support timed workouts (like planks) instead of just reps

# Completed
- Start storing basic data about a user and then using that when they return to chat
